# GI-GC-patches
Archived versions of *Anime Game* patches required to play on private servers. These include global-metadata files (2.8 and 3.0), UserAssembly files (3.1 and 3.2) and RSA patches (3.3 to 3.6). Lots of these were taken from the [Grasscutters Discord server](https://discord.gg/grasscutter), this repository is just here to easily archive and compile them into one resource if you want to play an old version of the game, or even the live version of the game on a private server.

## How to install?
Refer to [this tutorial](TUTORIAL.md).

## Sources
These are my exact sources for the files in this repository. The unpatched files for every version aside from Global 3.0 were taken from my own copy of the game, and are therefore the same ones official server uses. Although to be fair it's kind of pointless on old versions of the game but whatever, it doesn't hurt to have anyway.

## To-do
* Add MD5 hashes for each file (why not?).
* Get CN files (if different files are needed).
* Get normal 3.3 mhypbase.dll
* Hopefully someone can help verify the legitimacy of these files as I have not tested the 2.8-3.1 ones myself.
* Maybe include betas? Not sure if betas use a different patch to their live counterparts, but if they do it would be nice to have here.
